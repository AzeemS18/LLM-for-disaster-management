# 🌍 LLM-for-Disaster-Management

An intelligent disaster management system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating sensor data analysis, early warning generation, real-time communication, and rescue planning to minimize disaster impact and maximize response efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages cutting-edge AI techniques, including LLMs, to enhance disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. By integrating real-time data from sensors (thermal, LIDAR, beam detectors), satellite images, and user inputs, the system supports decision-making through predictive modeling, alert generation, and contextual understanding.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Real-time Disaster Detection** using sensor fusion
- 🧠 **LLM-based Analysis** of disaster reports, rescue plans, and government advisories
- 🔔 **Automatic Alert Generation** and SMS/email notifications
- 🛰️ **Geospatial Data Visualization** using maps and heatmaps
- 📡 **AI-assisted Communication** for emergency chatbots and responder coordination
- 📊 **Dashboard with Analytics** for disaster trends and affected regions
- 🤖 **Hexacopter Control System** for autonomous response and aerial mapping

## 📂 Directory Structure


## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Sensors and field units stream data to the backend.
2. **LLM Analysis** – LLM interprets data, emergency reports, and user queries.
3. **Alerts & Reports** – The system generates structured alerts, maps, and summaries.
4. **AI-based Planning** – Suggests optimal rescue paths and resource deployment.
5. **Interactive Dashboard** – Admin panel to view ongoing crises and statistics.

## 🧪 Use Cases

- Earthquake prediction and analysis
- Flood detection and response planning
- Fire outbreak analysis using thermal data
- Real-time drone coordination for search-and-rescue
- Emergency chatbot for public communication
